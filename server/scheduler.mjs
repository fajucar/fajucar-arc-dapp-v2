/**
 * Payment scheduler — runs every minute, executes due scheduled payments.
 *
 * Signing is routed by AUTOMATION_SIGNER (.env):
 *   - 'viem'   (default) — a single dedicated EOA (server/signer-viem.mjs)
 *              signs directly. Added because Circle's own balance API has a
 *              confirmed indexing gap on ARC-TESTNET — see
 *              server/scripts/diagnose-circle.mjs (tokenBalances comes back
 *              empty, even with includeAll: true, despite a real on-chain
 *              balance) — which made the Circle path unusable for testing.
 *   - 'circle' — the original Circle Developer Controlled Wallet path
 *              (executeContractCall from circle.mjs), kept intact. Switch
 *              back to this once Circle confirms the gap is fixed.
 *
 * Either way, the pre-send on-chain balance check (via server/onchain.mjs)
 * runs first and checks whichever address will actually sign — for 'circle'
 * that's the per-user Circle-managed wallet (payment.walletAddress); for
 * 'viem' that's the ONE shared automation EOA, regardless of which user's
 * payment it is.
